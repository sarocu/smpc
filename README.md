In-progress MPC framework for commercial buildings

This project consists of several tools for creating and manipulating meta-models using building energy simulation data as well as stochastic forecasting and simulation management to be used to study stochastic model predictive control in commercial buildings. This repository consists of the following packages:
* forecast - tools for creating stochastic scenarios using time series data
* meta - python class that allows users to construct statistical models from simulation or building trend data
* model - ruby tools for creating and simulating building models in OpenStudio
* superplus - simulation framework
